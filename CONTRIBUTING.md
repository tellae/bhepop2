# Bhepop2 contributing guidelines

## Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Bhepop2 ! 

Reading these guidelines eases the interactions between the project owners and the contributors - you !

We would love to see you contribute to make Bhepop2 a better project ! 
There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or examples, improving the documentation, 
submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Bhepop2 itself.


## Getting started

#### If you find a security vulnerability:

  - do NOT open an issue. Contact us directly instead

#### If you've found a bug:

  - read the error message and [documentation](https://starling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  - search through the [project issues](https://github.com/tellae/starling/issues?q=is%3Aissue++)
  - if the problem is with a dependency of this project, open an issue in the dependency's repo
  - if the problem is with Bhepop2 and you can fix it simply, please open a pull request
  - if the problem persists, please open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tellae/starling/issues), including a minimal working example so others can independently and completely reproduce the problem

#### If you have a feature proposal or want to contribute:

  - post your proposal on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/tellae/starling/issues) so we can review it together
  - fork the repo, make your change, test it, and submit a PR (do NOT merge the PR yourself)
  - respond to code review
  - adhere to the project code standards (see below)

## Coding style and commit messages
    
### Coding style

The coding style imposed on Bhepop2 includes:

  - respect [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) as much as possible
  - [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) code style with max line length of 100 (see below)
  - write code in english
  - use [Python typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) when possible
  - reST docstring style (for [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) documentation). Example: 

```python
def function(param1: str, param2: int):
    """
    This is a reST style.
    
    :param param1: this is a first param
    :param param2: this is a second param
    :returns: this is a description of what is returned
    :raises keyError: raises an exception
    """
    return param1, param2
```

#### Black formatting

Black formatting is done by installing and running Black at the project root. 
The only option to provide is the maximum line length.

```bash
black -l 100 .

# black will list every file modified during the process
```


Black style formatting is automatically checked when making a PR on GitHub.


### Commit message convention

Commits on branch `main` must use the [conventional commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
in order to generate a [changelog from the commits](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)

## Testing

### Run tests locally

Run tests from the root of the project using pytest. Use the -v option for verbose output.

```bash
pytest [-v]
```

Code coverage can be obtained with the pytest-cov plugin, using the following command

```bash
pytest --cov=bhepop2 --cov-report html
```

### Auto-run on PRs

Tests are automatically run when making a PR on gitHub

## Documentation

### Local generation

Documentation is generated using Sphinx. Pages are generated from the .rst files
in the *docs/* folder and from the code docstrings.

To render documentation locally, run the following command

```bash
sphinx-build -M html ./docs/ ./docs/_build/
```

You can then read the generated html files using any browser. For instance
```bash
firefox docs/_build/html/index.html
```

### Online hosting

The Sphinx documentation is hosted freely by ReadtheDocs for open source projects.
You can find the documentation of Bhepop2 [here](https://bhepop2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

A new version of the documentation is automatically deployed when running the *release* GitHub action.
