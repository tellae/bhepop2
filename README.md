# Bhepop2

A common problem in **generating a representative synthetic population** is that not all attributes of interest are present in the sample.  The purpose is to enrich the synthetic population with additional attributes, after the synthetic population is generated from the original sample.

In many cases, practitioners only have access to aggregated data for important socio-demographic attributes, such as income, education level. 

This package treats the problem to **enrich an initial synthetic population from an aggregated data** provided in the form of a distribution like deciles or quartiles.

## Authors

This package is the product of the joint work of the Gustave Eiffel university and the company Tellae.

It is based on a methodology called Bhepop2 (Bayesian Heuristic to Enrich POPulation by EntroPy OPtimization) and theoritically described, justified and discussed in

Vocabulary
* Attributes refer to  information in the initial sample or in the aggregate data, such as : age, profession, sex, etc
* Modalities are the partition of one attribute : sex has in our case study two modalities, female and male
* Cross Modalities are the intersection of two or more modalities, such as : female and above 65 years old
* Variable of interest are the degrees fo freedom of the optimisation problem
* Variables refer to the usual meaning of variables in a computer program
